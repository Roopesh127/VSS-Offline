      // ## For resolving async task there is one callback queue is created .

      // Callback Queue => Inside callback queue there is all setTimeout & setInterval are come .

      // microtask Queue => Inside microtask queue there is all data is come which is executed after resolved promises. Like that All fetch api(fetch is also take promises or a type of promises) , all promises sequensly.

      // --->  microtask queue and callback queue both are created parallely but microtask queue done most priority task and after that callback queue task is going to event loop.
      // --->  If there is two type of async task one is microtask data and another is callback queue data than , microtask queue data have priority , after execution of all microtask data , callback queue data will be executed.

      //  1. Callback Queue -> setTimeout , setinterval & all timer async.
      //  2. microtask Queue -> All data which are resolved by promises. Like fetch api , promises.

      //   console.log("start");

      //   setTimeout(function cbT() {
      //     console.log("CB SetTimeout");
      //   }, 5000);
